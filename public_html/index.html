					In this paper, we present a well-formed system for immigration data visualization. The United States is an immigration country since the beginning, and the immigration data is kept well by Department of Homeland Security (DHS). All of our data is from DHS to keep the accuracy and integrality. Our visualization system contains three aspect of immigration situation, which are historical trend, factor analysis and immigration flow. We also establish cascading steps for users to get a deeper knowledge of immigration situation by the three designs in our system. Proportional line chart, bipartite chart, choropleth maps and accordingly interactive design are used in our designs. The purpose of our system is to help the uses get a basic concept, as well as a deep understanding of the immigration situation in the United States.
